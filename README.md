# AID - Artificial Intelligence Drafting

Computer Aided Drafting is so 2022.

## About the Project

AI Drafting is the future, and the AID project is an ambitious attempt to leverage artificial intelligence to generate blueprints in a modular framework. The project aims to overcome the limitations imposed by the available token size in today's Large Language Models (LLM) while delivering high-quality blueprints.

The primary goal of AID is to explore the capabilities of AI in the field of drafting and design. By harnessing the power of deep learning and natural language processing, AID aims to automate the process of blueprint generation, making it more efficient and accurate.

## Key Features

- **Modular Framework:** AID follows a modular framework, allowing different components to work together seamlessly. This approach enables flexibility and scalability, making it easier to integrate new features and improve existing ones.

- **AI Blueprint Generation:** Using advanced machine learning techniques, AID generates blueprints based on the input provided. The AI model is trained on a vast dataset of architectural designs and can produce accurate and detailed blueprints.

- **Token Optimization:** AID addresses the challenge of token size limitations in LLMs. The project incorporates innovative strategies to optimize the token usage, ensuring that the blueprint generation process remains within the available token limits.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** AID provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the AI drafting system. Users can input their requirements and preferences, and AID will generate blueprints accordingly, providing a seamless experience.
